## Rubinius Sends a Message in a Bottle

### The once and future system.

One essential component of Vivarium is the use of proper languages as
interfaces for agents to use to communicate with tools and other agents, as
well as to define the system.

A number of ideas from over ten years ago in Rubinius, which started life as an
alternate implementation of the Ruby programming language, are being revived
under the generous sponsorship of the experienced security professionals at
[Semper Victus](https://www.sempervictus.com).

There's a lot to be done, so if languages interest you, or even if you're just
curious about how that might work, catch up with the recent post: *["New Phone,
Who 'Dis?"](https://rubinius.com/blog/2025-11-07-new-phone-who-dis/)*.

## News Around Your Towns

IBM sponsored event. Highlights from the three talks:

* LangFlow and MCP: they work
* Beware AI: the AI Risk Atlas
* Keeping Up with the JonesAI: is there any ROI?

## Reader's Corner

If you are new to the Vivarium community or a new reader of the newsletters,
welcome!

If you discover things that you think would benefit the community and want to
share, send them along to `news@vivarium-ai.com`.

Each week, we'll feature something from the community in this section.

## How's it Tracking?

Coordination is difficult in the best of times. It's many times more difficult
across all the globe's timezones, languages, cultures, and weather patterns.

The [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/vivarium-ai/projects) set up at
the [Vivarium GitHub organization](https://github.com/vivarium-ai) level are
the main method for keeping track of what has been done, what needs to be done,
and what's happening now.

This section of the newsletter will highlight important milestones or things of
note from the previous week.

## London Calling...

According to the lyrics:

  The ice age is coming, sun zooming in
  Meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin

Hopefully the current LLM AI bubble won't cause as dramatic a scene, but there
are plenty of things that you can do, no matter your background or experience
level, to help advance real, useful, and safe machine intelligence.

Each week, we'll highlight an area that could use some immediate attention. If
you have ideas, holler at us `london@vivarium-ai.com`.

## Looking Forward to Next Week

The compiler, and maybe a dash of Python
