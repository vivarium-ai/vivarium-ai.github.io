Welcome to the first Vivarium AI weekly newsletter!

## Vivarium Boots Up

There is a brand new, hot off the presses, still a bit ragged around the edges,
[website](https://vivarium-ai.com) for the Vivarium AI project. In fact, you
may even be reading this right now at that very website. If not, send your
friends there!

The Vivarium AI project kicks off with a series of [blog
posts](https://vivarium-ai.com/blog/2025-11-08-the-vivarium-ai-experimentation-platform/)
explaining the concepts and goals of the project. There are a lot more of those
coming, so bookmark [the blog](https://vivarium-ai.com/blog/).

It turns out, maybe attention isn't all you need, and explaining the
ins-and-outs, ups-and-downs, and around-and-arounds of AI can get a bit
detailed, so [there are docs](https://vivarium-ai.com/docs/) for your reading
pleasure.  (Yes, they are a wind-swept prairie before the grass seed sprouts
right now, but you have to start somewhere.)

The documentation is modeled after the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr)
framework ("A systematic approach to technical documentation authoring.") We
think you'll love it once you can read some.

Did I mention the [newsletters](https://vivarium-ai.com/newsletters)? Oh, I
did? Ok, there are weekly newsletters, starting this week, and continuing
weekly, for weeks and weeks. Please help.

If you're a staunch believer that the pen is mightier than the sword, bring
your pens to the [Vivarium Discussion Forum for the Advancement of Various AI
Entities](https://github.com/orgs/vivarium-ai/discussions) and Discuss Away!

But if chatting is more your cup of tea, there is also a brand-spanking-new
[Discord experience](https://discord.gg/25GuZR4fBN) awaiting your lovely
presence.

If you're more of a summary person, we've got you covered, too. Head over and
sign up to the [mailing list](https://vivarium-ai.com) and we'll drip you the
good stuff once or twice a month. It's the best way to stay connected and never
think about it again.

To help keep track of all the work, we're using [GitHub
Projects](https://github.com/orgs/vivarium-ai/projects). These are currently
arranged around the core components of Vivarium, but we can adapt them as
needed. If you think something needs immediate attention, please don't hesitate
to [open an issue](https://github.com/vivarium-ai/vivarium/issues/new).

So there are a few notes about Vivarium. Not a lot, but we're just getting
started. And speaking of started, let's go back in time, oh ten or twenty
years, and check in on the Rubinius language platform...

## Rubinius Sends a Message in a Bottle

### The once and future system.

One essential component of Vivarium is the use of proper languages as
interfaces for agents to use to communicate with tools and other agents, as
well as to define the system.

A number of ideas from over [ten years ago in
Rubinius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), which started life as
an alternate implementation of the Ruby programming language, are being revived
under the generous sponsorship of the experienced security professionals at
[Semper Victus](https://www.sempervictus.com).

There's a lot to be done, so if languages interest you, or even if you're just
curious about how that might work, catch up with the recent post: *["New Phone,
Who 'Dis?"](https://rubinius.com/blog/2025-11-07-new-phone-who-dis/)*.

## News Around Your Towns

There was an IBM sponsored event, [Hacking Agents
PDX](https://luma.com/pdx-hacking-agents) in Portland last week. Everyone I
spoke to was surprised to see IBM doing something in our little town, but it
was pretty interesting.

Here are some highlights from the three talks:

* **Carter Rabasa** (Head of Developer Relations, Open Platform AI @ IBM):
  Carter kicked things off by building an AI Agent live, showcasing both an MCP
  server and client in action. Carter presented all this through the lens of
  [Langflow](https://www.langflow.org). **Takeaway:** there's a lot of activity and
  MCP is extremely well-supported across many different projects.
* **Derek Roy** (World Wide Sales Enablement, AI & Agentic Content Ops @ IBM):
  Derek talked about what makes Agentic AI enterprise-ready, from scalability
  to governance. He mentioned taking a look at [IBM AI Risk
  Atlas](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=ai-risk-atlas).
  **Takeaway:** there are a bajillion ways deploying AI can go wrong. It's not
  for the faint of heart and also please do it responsibly. Humanity thanks
  you in advance.
* **Tobias Eld** (General Manager, Analytics Solutions @ Fresche Solutions):
  Tobias hails from deep in the real-world industry space and presented several
  case studies showing how Agentic AI is already transforming specific
  verticals. **Takeaway:** Tobias stressed checking if there isn't already an
  OTS (off-the-shelf) solution for AI functionality your organization may be
  considering. We've moved beyond the bespoke systems phase in a lot of areas.

Over the past few weeks, I've attended a few in-person events and my sense is
that people are so ready to move on from the pandemic era and are eager to get
in front of people. I'm thinking about starting up a weekly hack session in
Portland.

If you know of folks in your area getting together regularly to hack on
projects, drop us a note at `social@vivarium-ai.com` and we'll share it out.

## Reader's Corner

If you are new to the Vivarium community or a new reader of the newsletters,
welcome!

If you discover things that you think would benefit the community and want to
share, send them along to `news@vivarium-ai.com`.

Each week, we'll feature something from the community in this section.

## How's it Tracking?

Coordination is difficult in the best of times. It's many times more difficult
across all the globe's time zones, languages, cultures, and weather patterns.

The [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/vivarium-ai/projects) at the
[Vivarium GitHub organization](https://github.com/vivarium-ai) level is the
main method for keeping track of what has been done, what needs to be done, and
what's happening now.

This section of the newsletter will highlight important milestones or things of
note from the previous week.

## London Calling...

According to [the lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfK-WX2pa8c):

```
  The ice age is coming, sun zooming in
  Meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin
```

Hopefully, the current LLM AI bubble won't cause as dramatic a scene, but there
are plenty of things that you can do, no matter your background or experience
level, to help advance real, useful, and safe machine intelligence.

Each week, we'll highlight an area that could use some immediate attention. If
you have ideas, holler at us: `london@vivarium-ai.com`.

## Looking Forward to Next Week

We're still in the bootstrapping phase, so lots of boots and straps on the
agenda for this week:

* [Package the Ruby Prism parser for integration](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/issues/3858)
* [Package the Python PEG parser for integration](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/issues/3859)
* [Add the LLVM fork to GitHub CI](https://github.com/rubinius/compiler-ng/issues/1)
* [Add the minimum Rubinius TableGen backend to LLVM](https://github.com/rubinius/compiler-ng/issues/2)
* [Integrate the Prism parser](https://github.com/rubinius/compiler-ng/issues/3)
* [Add the minimum asm and object writer to LLVM](https://github.com/rubinius/compiler-ng/issues/4)

Have something you want to work on? It's all free and open source, so dive right in!

Have a lovely week!
