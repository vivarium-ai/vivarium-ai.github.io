## AI Agents

Artificial machine intelligence, and indeed, artificial "general" intelligence,
is the core concept that binds the rest of these efforts.

In Vivarium, the "agent" is a container for an intelligence. It forms the
boundary through which the agent interacts with the world.

As such, the agent concept is agnostic to what form that intelligence may take.
In fact, the way a human interacts with the Vivarium system "from the inside"
is via an agent proxy.

In this way, an agent in Vivarium can immediately be implemented using an
existing LLM API.

But because the agent concept is agnostic about what intelligence it contains,
it provides a key capability to decoupling from the existing dominant LLM
paradigm but still being able to use and evaluate it, while seamlessly
incorporating various other research paradigms, including our own.

The AI agent also is central to being able to distribute training, evolution,
and usage across consumer-grade mobile devices, tablets, and laptops. This
enables the location for the compute of the agent to be separated from the
computing device providing the resource under the rest of the Vivarium
instance.

### How to Think About the Languge Interface

The language and language-related tools (e.g. the compiler assembly, including
the JIT machinery) are obviously useful in a stand-alone manner because
languages and compilers have been used to build many kinds of applications.

But since general purpose languages are so useful, most programmers don't
consider language tools to be that useful. They have something "good enough" in
the general purpose language they use for primarily the domain they work with
(roughly: Ruby for webapps, Python for data science, numerical computing, and
AI models, Go for networked distributed systems, Rust for "systems
programming", C for stack overflows).

So apart from a distinct component, the AI agent also provides context for the
utility of the language element of this system.

The "AI agent" container component of this system is agnostic to the sort of
"AI" within the agent. The agent interface is an abstraction of communication
with the agent. Agents may communicate with each other, with tools, and with
the environment.

It is possible for a person to "inhabit" an agent to participate in the world
and communicate with other agents. This uniformity of agents containing
intelligence clarifies and simplifies the architecture without loss of
generality.

### Necessary Attributes of (Ideal) Agents

The goal is to experimentally create real intelligence, where learning,
understanding, and sense-making transfer to new domains with ever-improving
accuracy and power. This would contrast sharply with the current scheme, which
has an inverse relationship between generality and accuracy (i.e. the more
general, the less accurate inescapably).

The following are structural elements of agents, where they:

* **Inhabit a world**;
* Have a **"language interface" (expanded on in section 2 below) for input and output**;
* Have a **"language interface" to tools** (expanded on in section 3 below);
* Have an **operational (most likely "language") interface** to the world they exist within;
* **Produce telemetry** that is combined with the world and tool telemetry;
* Are able to **use the telemetry as feedback**.

And these (or many of them) should be required core functions or capabilities:

* **Embedded and located in a world with space-time**. This is essential to causality;
* **Sensorimotor capabilities** in the broadest sense. The ability to perceive and act;
* **Intentionality**, acting in pursuit of a goal;
* **Boredom**, essentially an internal state of insufficient novelty in recent experience;
* **Curiosity**, and urge to question and pursue "What would happen if...?"
* **Purpose**, these are individual, internal
* **Goals**, these are external and can be collective, must be multiple and often will be in conflict
* **Motivation**, the direction of attention and energy toward a goal
* **Drive**, a force moving foward
* **Learning not training**, may be externally (goals provided) or internally (curiosity) guided;
* **Understanding**, closes the loop between perception, learning, intentionality, acting;

The concepts of perception, goals, causality, etc are used in the most general
sense. An agent could "intend to find the error in a piece of code by
understanding the looping structure where the error is happening and trying
changes, potentially, but hopefully not exclusively at random".

All of these concepts should be rigorounly defined and vigorously
de-anthropomorphized. This itself constitutes a significant amount of work on
the agent aspect of Vivarium.

[Dynamic Field Theory](https://dynamicfieldtheory.org) has already established
quite substantial progress on many of these but it appears to lack good
surrounding infrastructure.
