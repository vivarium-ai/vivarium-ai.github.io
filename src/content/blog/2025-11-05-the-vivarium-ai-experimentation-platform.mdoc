## Is Artificial Intelligence Real?

## What is Vivarium?

This proposal is a comprehensive framework for a research and experimentation platform based on four core elements of a RealAI™ system:

1. AI definitions and models;
1. Machine language and human-machine language interfaces;
1. Tools;
1. Infrastructure;

The totality of this system is also an entity: **Vivarium**.

The **"AI agents"** exist within a **"world"** and use **"language interfaces"** to **"tools"**. The worlds are described (structure and functionality) using languages capable of computation (i.e. not simply YAML or HCL etc).

The **"infrastructure"** is a combination of the computational resources (processor, memory, storage) to run the worlds and agents, and the controlling mechanisms for those computational resources.

Within the agents, an evolutionary mechanism can be introduced, again based on a language, that permits unguided exploration of solution spaces with respect to the structure or function of the agents.

The three other components are agnostic about the specific functioning of the "AI agent" component other than the agents' interface, which allows agents to interact with one another and with the world in which they are embedded and with the tools to which they have access.

## An Immensely Consequential Decision

## To Learn or Not to Learn

If we had persisted with the notion that the way to elevate oneself above the ground was to use a ladder because to everyone it appeared to usually work just fine, we never would have reached the moon.

If you're a critical observer, LLMs don't even appear to work much of the time, so continuing to pour billions of dollars into "scaling" them borders on an absurdity beyond the words to express it.

The idea that autonomous driving must "learn the city" in order to function obviously does not match our experience as human drivers, so even if it's the best we're capable of at this moment, it shouldn't be accepted as a reasonable approach to autonomous driving.

I'll go even further and plainly state that multi-trillion dollar market cap companies have no real utiility or valuable contribution to the world economy. The goal should be putting AI in the service of every individual to enable them to live a happier, healthier, more fulfilling life alongside their friends and loved ones no matter where they are in the world. No company or group of companies should have a monopoly on that.
